Chunker: motion-based, variable-length video splitting.

Main entry:
    chunk_video(
        video_path: str,
        min_chunk: int = 4,
        max_chunk: int = 24,
        motion_threshold: float = 0.0375,
        frame_sample_rate: int = 40,
    ) -> list[CVClip]

What it does:
    Reads a video and returns a list of subclips (CVClip) whose boundaries
    are decided by pixel-level motion (OpenCV). Chunks are at least `min_chunk`
    seconds, at most `max_chunk` seconds.

Inputs:
    video_path: path to the input video
    min_chunk: minimum chunk length in seconds
    max_chunk: maximum chunk length in seconds
    motion_threshold: normalized [0..1] motion trigger
    frame_sample_rate: process every Nth frame for efficiency

Output:
    A list of CVClip subclips. Remember to close them when done.

Usage:
    from chunker import chunk_video, close_video_chunks
    chunks = chunk_video("eagle.mp4", min_chunk=4, max_chunk=24)
    # ... use chunks ...
    close_video_chunks(chunks)  # free resources when done
